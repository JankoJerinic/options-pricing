# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for building a comprehensive SPX options pricing system designed for backtesting trading strategies. The system will calculate theoretical options prices using market data from Polygon and various pricing models, enabling accurate historical analysis of options trading strategies across different market conditions.

## Glossary

- **SPX_System**: The complete options pricing and backtesting system for S&P 500 index options
- **Polygon_API**: The market data provider interface for retrieving historical and real-time market data
- **Options_Pricer**: The component responsible for calculating theoretical options prices using various models
- **Backtest_Engine**: The component that executes historical trading strategy simulations
- **Market_Data_Store**: The data storage and retrieval system for historical market information using Parquet files with local storage and cloud migration capability
- **Volatility_Surface**: A three-dimensional representation of implied volatility across strikes and expirations
- **Greeks_Calculator**: Component that computes option sensitivities (delta, gamma, theta, vega, rho)
- **Risk_Free_Rate**: The theoretical rate of return on an investment with zero risk, typically based on Treasury rates

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a quantitative analyst, I want to retrieve comprehensive historical market data for SPX and related instruments, so that I can build accurate pricing models for options backtesting.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE SPX_System SHALL store SPX daily OHLC data for 20-year historical periods in Parquet format
2. THE SPX_System SHALL store SPX 1-minute granularity data for the most recent 1-year period in Parquet format
3. THE SPX_System SHALL store VIX daily OHLC data for 20-year historical periods and 1-minute data for the past year
4. THE SPX_System SHALL obtain risk-free interest rates (Treasury rates) at daily granularity for 20-year historical periods
5. THE SPX_System SHALL retrieve dividend yield data for SPX at daily granularity for 20-year historical periods

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a quantitative analyst, I want to access comprehensive options market data, so that I can calibrate pricing models and validate theoretical calculations against market prices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE SPX_System SHALL retrieve historical options prices for all SPX contracts with bid, ask, and last prices
2. THE SPX_System SHALL collect implied volatility data for each options contract at end-of-day intervals
3. THE SPX_System SHALL obtain open interest and volume data for all SPX options contracts
4. THE SPX_System SHALL retrieve options chain data including all available strikes and expirations for each trading day
5. WHERE options data is incomplete, THE SPX_System SHALL interpolate missing values using market-standard methodologies

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a quantitative analyst, I want to calculate theoretical options prices using multiple pricing models, so that I can compare model accuracy and select the most appropriate method for different market conditions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Options_Pricer SHALL implement Black-Scholes pricing model for European-style options
2. THE Options_Pricer SHALL implement binomial tree models with configurable time steps for American-style features
3. THE Options_Pricer SHALL implement Monte Carlo simulation pricing with variance reduction techniques
4. THE Options_Pricer SHALL support stochastic volatility models (Heston model) for advanced pricing scenarios
5. WHERE multiple models are available, THE Options_Pricer SHALL provide model comparison and selection capabilities

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a quantitative analyst, I want to construct and maintain accurate volatility surfaces, so that I can price options across different strikes and expirations with market-consistent implied volatilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE SPX_System SHALL construct daily volatility surfaces using market implied volatilities from options prices
2. THE SPX_System SHALL interpolate volatility surfaces across strikes using cubic spline or similar smooth interpolation
3. THE SPX_System SHALL extrapolate volatility surfaces for strikes beyond market-quoted ranges using wing models
4. THE SPX_System SHALL maintain historical volatility surfaces for back-testing across different time periods
5. WHERE market data is sparse, THE SPX_System SHALL apply volatility surface smoothing techniques to ensure arbitrage-free pricing

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a quantitative analyst, I want to calculate comprehensive option Greeks, so that I can understand risk exposures and hedge positions effectively in my back-testing strategies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Greeks_Calculator SHALL compute first-order Greeks (delta, theta, vega, rho) for all options positions
2. THE Greeks_Calculator SHALL compute second-order Greeks (gamma, vanna, volga) for advanced risk management
3. THE Greeks_Calculator SHALL aggregate portfolio-level Greeks across multiple positions and expirations
4. THE Greeks_Calculator SHALL support Greeks calculation under different volatility and interest rate scenarios
5. WHERE Greeks are used for hedging, THE Greeks_Calculator SHALL provide real-time Greeks updates as market conditions change

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a quantitative analyst, I want to execute comprehensive backtests of options trading strategies, so that I can evaluate strategy performance across different market regimes and time periods.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Backtest_Engine SHALL simulate strategy execution with configurable entry and exit rules
2. THE Backtest_Engine SHALL account for realistic transaction costs including bid-ask spreads and commissions
3. THE Backtest_Engine SHALL handle options expiration, assignment, and exercise scenarios accurately
4. THE Backtest_Engine SHALL provide detailed performance metrics including Sharpe ratio, maximum drawdown, and win rate
5. WHERE strategies involve complex multi-leg positions, THE Backtest_Engine SHALL manage position lifecycle and P&L attribution correctly

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a quantitative analyst, I want to store and efficiently retrieve large volumes of historical market data, so that I can perform rapid backtesting across extended time periods without performance bottlenecks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Market_Data_Store SHALL store time-series data in Parquet format for optimized compression and fast retrieval
2. THE Market_Data_Store SHALL maintain local file storage with capability to migrate to cloud storage (S3)
3. THE Market_Data_Store SHALL provide indexed access to data by date, symbol, and contract specifications
4. THE Market_Data_Store SHALL support incremental data updates to maintain rolling 1-year minute data and 20-year daily data
5. WHERE data integrity is critical, THE Market_Data_Store SHALL implement data validation and error correction mechanisms
