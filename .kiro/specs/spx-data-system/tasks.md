# Market Data System Implementation Plan

## Testing Requirements

**IMPORTANT**: All task implementations must be accompanied by comprehensive unit tests that target newly added features. A task can only be considered complete when:

1. **Unit Tests Created**: Each task must include unit tests that cover:

   - Core functionality of all new classes, methods, and functions
   - Edge cases and error conditions
   - Input validation and boundary conditions
   - Integration points between components

2. **All Tests Pass**: The entire project test suite must pass without failures

   - Run `python -m pytest tests/ -v` to verify all tests pass
   - Address any test failures before marking a task as complete
   - Maintain or improve overall test coverage

3. **Test Quality Standards**:

   - Tests should be focused on core functional logic
   - Use descriptive test names that explain what is being tested
   - Include both positive (happy path) and negative (error) test cases
   - Mock external dependencies appropriately
   - Follow the existing test structure and naming conventions

4. **Coverage Expectations**:
   - New code should have meaningful test coverage
   - Critical business logic must be thoroughly tested
   - Configuration and validation logic requires comprehensive testing
