# Market Data System Requirements

## Introduction

The Market Data System is a comprehensive data management platform for collecting, storing, and retrieving market data for any ticker symbol including stocks, indices, ETFs, and their associated options chains. This system serves as the foundation for quantitative analysis and trading strategies, providing reliable, high-quality market data across multiple timeframes through a clean API.

## Glossary

- **Market_Data_System**: The complete data management system for multi-ticker market data
- **Polygon_API**: Third-party market data provider API service
- **Data_Storage**: Local file-based storage system using Parquet format organized by ticker and timeframe
- **Options_Chain**: Complete set of options contracts for any optionable ticker on a specific date
- **Daily_Data**: OHLCV (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume) price data aggregated by trading day
- **Minute_Data**: OHLCV price data aggregated by minute intervals
- **Ticker_Symbol**: Any valid market symbol (stocks, indices, ETFs, etc.)
- **Data_Validation**: Process of checking data quality and completeness across tickers and timeframes
- **CLI_Tool**: Command-line interface for data operations

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a quantitative analyst, I want to fetch daily market data for any ticker from Polygon API, so that I have reliable historical price data for analysis.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system receives a request for ticker data with date range, THE Market_Data_System SHALL fetch Daily_Data from Polygon_API
2. WHEN Polygon_API returns data, THE Market_Data_System SHALL validate data completeness and format
3. IF API request fails, THEN THE Market_Data_System SHALL retry up to 3 times with exponential backoff
4. WHEN data is successfully fetched, THE Market_Data_System SHALL store data in Data_Storage organized by ticker and year

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a quantitative analyst, I want to fetch minute-level market data for any ticker, so that I can perform high-frequency analysis and backtesting.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system receives a request for minute data with ticker and date, THE Market_Data_System SHALL fetch Minute_Data from Polygon_API
2. WHEN minute data is received, THE Market_Data_System SHALL validate timestamp sequence and data completeness
3. WHILE processing minute data, THE Market_Data_System SHALL handle market hours and filter invalid timestamps
4. WHEN minute data is validated, THE Market_Data_System SHALL store data organized by ticker, year, and trading day

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a quantitative analyst, I want to fetch options chain data for any optionable ticker, so that I can analyze options market structure and pricing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system receives a request for options data with ticker and date, THE Market_Data_System SHALL fetch complete Options_Chain from Polygon_API
2. WHEN options data is received, THE Market_Data_System SHALL validate required fields (strike, expiration, bid, ask, volume, open_interest)
3. WHILE processing options data, THE Market_Data_System SHALL filter out contracts with zero bid and ask prices
4. WHEN options data is validated, THE Market_Data_System SHALL store data organized by ticker and expiration date

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a quantitative analyst, I want to retrieve stored market data efficiently for any ticker and timeframe, so that I can perform analysis without repeated API calls.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system receives a data retrieval request with ticker and timeframe, THE Market_Data_System SHALL check Data_Storage for existing data
2. WHEN requested data exists locally, THE Market_Data_System SHALL return data within 1 second for daily data and within 5 seconds for minute data
3. IF requested data is missing, THEN THE Market_Data_System SHALL indicate data availability status with specific missing date ranges
4. WHEN loading data, THE Market_Data_System SHALL validate data integrity using checksums and handle multiple file concatenation

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a quantitative analyst, I want to validate data quality across all tickers and timeframes, so that I can trust the data for analysis.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data is stored, THE Market_Data_System SHALL perform Data_Validation checks for completeness across all timeframes
2. WHEN validation detects missing data, THE Market_Data_System SHALL log specific gaps with ticker, timeframe, and dates
3. WHILE validating options data, THE Market_Data_System SHALL check for reasonable bid-ask spreads and strike price distributions
4. WHEN validation completes, THE Market_Data_System SHALL generate comprehensive data quality report by ticker

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a quantitative analyst, I want command-line tools for multi-ticker data management, so that I can easily fetch and manage data across my universe of securities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN CLI_Tool is invoked with fetch command, THE Market_Data_System SHALL fetch data for specified tickers, timeframes, and date ranges
2. WHEN CLI_Tool is invoked with status command, THE Market_Data_System SHALL display data availability summary organized by ticker and timeframe
3. WHEN CLI_Tool is invoked with validate command, THE Market_Data_System SHALL run Data_Validation across all stored tickers and display results
4. IF CLI_Tool encounters errors, THEN THE Market_Data_System SHALL display helpful error messages with ticker-specific context and suggested actions
